# Hostel-management

This Project "HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” targeted for the College Hostel integrates the transaction management of the Hostel for better control and timely response. The student is provided with options to register with his details, apply the leave application form, register complaints and express suggestions to the admins.  A separate login is provided for the warden to access the student details and complaints. The warden can search for a particular student and view the student’s  details. Wardens can also see the received complaints and suggestions. This project's main motto is to reduce the effort of Wardens and provide better service to the students.
The goal of this project is to develop a system for the computerization of the Hostel. The common transactions of the hostel include the maintenance of information about students in the hostel, enrolling of new students, registering complaints stored in the databases, and reports generated according to the user requirements.
